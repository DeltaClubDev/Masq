SMS Encryption android applcation

I have forked this for the following reason:

Currently, for a secure communication one would have to create a new key for every new message exchanged.
For a more user friendly way, I will make use of randomly generated IV's.
This helps users to exchange keys less often, and make for a more user friendly communication.
Otherwise, I like this app :)
